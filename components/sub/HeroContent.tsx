          In 2013 I began the most amazing journey as an early adopter, investor, and miner in digital assets during the height of my former career as a high school teacher. After getting cancer and having to return home, I also had to give up teaching. I went back for another Master's (MBA) and doubled down on crypto finance.  I used to be a web developer so I modernized my tech stack, learned Solidity and performed security assessments for blockchains and smart contracts at Coinbase. Now I'm 100% healthy again and a web3 founder and builder with industry experience in blockchain security. My areas of expertise include smart contract dev, nfts, ai prompting, design, and digital art.
